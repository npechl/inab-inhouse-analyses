If the quality drops significantly at the end of the reads, you may need to perform trimming.\n✅ Adapter Content: If this module fails, it means Illumina adapter sequences were detected. You must remove these before alignment.\n✅ Sequence Duplication Levels: High duplication can indicate PCR over-amplification or low library complexity.\n\n\n[!TIP] MultiQC: If you have dozens of samples, looking at individual reports is slow.

Just drag & drop the file from the left to the right window.\nDefine a distinctive name for the folder that will contain the bases2fastq results (e.g., 2025_05_21_ERIC_study) and use it as input (check the command below)\nNow you can execute bases2fastq (version 2.1.0.1522407762), based on the following command:\nnohup /apps/element/bases2fastq \\\n--num-threads 16 \\\n--group-fastq \\\n--legacy-fastq \\\n--run-manifest RunManifest.csv \\\n/mnt/new_home/element/AV240301/20250131_AV240301_SARSDIAGNOSIS/ \\\n2025_05_21_ERIC_study/ &gt; ./2025_05_21_ERIC_study.log 2&gt;&1 &\nAfter the command for bases2fastq has run successfully, move your RunManifest.csv to the output folder:\nmv RunManifest.csv 2025_05_21_ERIC_study\nFiles older than 2 weeks will be automatically deleted from shared folders!\nFor this reason, if we have run the analysis in a shared folder such as /mnt/new_home/element_common_fastq, we should transfer the final files to our own subfolder, which will be located under our research group’s folder.\nrsync -r \\\n2025_05_21_ERIC_study \\\n/mnt/new_home/stamatopoulos_research"
