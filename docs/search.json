If the quality drops significantly at the end of the reads, you may need to perform trimming.\n✅ Adapter Content: If this module fails, it means Illumina adapter sequences were detected. You must remove these before alignment.\n✅ Sequence Duplication Levels: High duplication can indicate PCR over-amplification or low library complexity.\n\n\n[!TIP] MultiQC: If you have dozens of samples, looking at individual reports is slow.
