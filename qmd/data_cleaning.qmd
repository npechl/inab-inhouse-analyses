## Data Cleaning

Bioinformatics tools are very strict about filenames, sample IDs, and metadata.

Even one wrong character can:

-   break pipelines

-   mismatch samples

-   cause failed downstream analyses (DESeq2, Seurat)

-   make reproducibility impossible

So, we require **standardized naming**.

## ❌ Common Naming Problems

List of common **errors** found in metadata:

-   Duplicate sample names (e.g., `sample1` appearing twice)

-   Greek characters (`α`, `β`, `Α`, `Τ`)

-   Spaces in names (`Sample 1`, `Control rep 2`)

-   Special characters (`!`, `%`, `@`, `#`, `(`, `)`, `/`)

## ✅ The Correct Naming Rules

Sample names **MUST**:
