## How to run **fastqc** in the computational infrastructure of INAB

#### Steps to run fastqc analysis:

1.  Log in to the appropriate server:

    o 160.40.71.4

    o 160.40.71.6

2.  Identify where your NGS results (.fastq files) are located:

    o e.g., /mnt/new_home/stamatopoulos_research/2025_05_21_ERIC_study

3.  Move to the precmed working directory:

    o cd /work/precmed/varCall/

4.  Create a new analysis directory:

    o mkdir run-2025-05-22-fastqc

5.  Run the fastqc (you have to update with the right path to your fastq files):

    fastqc /mnt/new_home/stamatopoulos_research/2025_05_21_ERIC_study/\*.fastq.gz\
    -o run-2025-05-22-fastqc/
