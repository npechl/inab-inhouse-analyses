## How to run **fastqc** in the computational infrastructure of INAB

### Steps to run fastqc analysis:

1.  Log in to the appropriate server:

    o 160.40.71.4

2.  Identify where your NGS results (.fastq files) are located:

    o e.g., /mnt/new_home/stamatopoulos_research/2025_05_21_ERIC_study

3.  Move to the precmed working directory:

    ``` bash
    cd /work/precmed/varCall/
    ```

4.  Create a new analysis directory:

    ``` bash
    mkdir run-2025-05-22-fastqc
    ```

5.  Run the fastqc (you have to update with the right **path** to your **fastq files**):

    ``` bash
    fastqc /mnt/new_home/stamatopoulos_research/2025_05_21_ERIC_study/*.fastq.gz -o run-2025-05-22-fastqc/
    ```
